Q1 - Why branching is important in any workflow ? How does it help ?

Ans 1- The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This  makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase.


Q2 - Write the command for viewing all the branches present in remote repo?

A2- git branch-r

for listing local repo too - git branch-a	


Q3 - Write the command for deleting a branch?

A3- // delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

You can also use this shorter command to delete a branch remotely: git push <remote> :<branch>

For example: git push origin :fix/authentication .
If you get the error below, it may mean that someone else has already deleted the branch.
