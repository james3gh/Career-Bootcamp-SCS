Q1 - Why branching is important in any workflow ? How does it help ?
    Branching allows us to seperate the work we are currently doing, which may be prone to errors, from the working model.
    Also it allows us to check the current work before merging with the original work.

Q2 - Write the command for viewing all the branches present in remote repo?
git branch -r

Q3 - Write the command for deleting a branch?
git branch -d "Name"
