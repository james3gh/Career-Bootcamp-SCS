Q1 - Why branching is important in any workflow ? How does it help ?

Ans - The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the main branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

Q2 - Write the command for viewing all the branches present in remote repo?

Ans - git branch -r

Q3 - Write the command for deleting a branch?

Ans - // delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
