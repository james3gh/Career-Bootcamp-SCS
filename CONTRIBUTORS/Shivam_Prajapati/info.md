Q1. we use git for it's benefits as a version control system, it helps us to monitor changes to our projects. It allows us suitable features that helps us work in groups. We can keep a track of systems maintain our versions, etc.

Q2. forking - forking is like copying a repository to own github account. after forking, the repo becomes free from main code and you are free to make changes in it. cloning - cloning is like making a local copy of remote a remote repo. this way you can make changes locally in your repo.

Q 3. a) Staging area is area between the steps .add command and .commit command. It is the gap between the steps when we are done with our changes, collect the individual files and commit it to the main project.

b) git push command allows us to send or push our local updated files to our remote repository on github.
