Ans 1- To handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

Ans2- Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account. Cloning a repository creates a copy of the original repository on our local machine. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.

Ans3-
a)The staging area can be described as a preview of our next commit. When we create a git commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make them as a new commit. we are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging area. The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the changes.

b) The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
