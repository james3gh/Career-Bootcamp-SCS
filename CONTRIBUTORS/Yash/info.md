Q1 - Why do we use git? 
Ans - Git is a version control system for keeping track of changes to files. Using Git lets you always have a record of all adjustments, and return to specific versions when needed. Using it is easy to learn and takes up minimal space with high productivity.

Q2 - What is meant by forking and cloning a repo? 
Ans - Forking is done on the GitHub Account while Cloning is done using Git. When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account. Whereas, when you clone a repository, the repository is copied on to your local machine with the help of Git.

Q3 - a) What do you understand about the Staging area in Git?
     b) What does the git push command do? 
Ans -
     a) The staging area is a middle ground between what you have done to your files (the working directory) and what you have last committed (the HEAD commit). Just like the name implies, it lets you prepare (stage) what the next commit will be and most importantly give you tools to easily know what is going on. This adds some complexity but also adds more flexibility to selectively prepare commits since you can modify and stage several times before committing.
     b) The Git push command is used to push the local repository content to a remote repository. After a local repository has been modified, a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team members. Pushing is the way commits are transferred from the local repository to the remote repository.
